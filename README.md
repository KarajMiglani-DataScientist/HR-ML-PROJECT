# HR-ML-PROJECT
##OVERVIEW
Hiring tems often face the challenge of candidates declining offers at the last moment. This causes delays,lost productivity, and increased hiring effort
This project uses Machine Learning to predict the probability of a candidate joining vs. not joining based on HR profile data.

*The aim is to help organizations:

*Reduce offer dropouts

*Identify high-risk candidates early

*Improve hiring decisions with data-driven insights

Problem Statement

This is a binary classification problem:

1 → Candidate Joined

0 → Candidate Did Not Join

HR machine learning project- in which i have to come up with prediction model to figure out whether the candidate is going to actually join the company or not
